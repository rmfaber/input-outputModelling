# Assignment for EPA 1223

I used the world input out database for an input-output assignment.

My assignment is to model the effects of industry C17 in Germany.

Some of the questions were answered using the excel sheet, as they were about simple addition or subtraction.

For the more difficult questions I extracted the relevant vectors using R and calculated technical requirement & Leontief matrices for both an open and a closed model.
