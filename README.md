# WIOD Database

I used the world input out database for an assignment.

This database can be found at http://www.wiod.org/home

More information about the construction and use of the database can be found in the following paper:

# Assignment

My assignment is to model the effects of industry C17 in Germany.

Some of the questions were answered using the excel sheet, as they were about simple addition or subtraction.

For the more difficult questions I extracted the relevant vectors using R and calculated technical requirement & Leontief matrices for both an open and a closed model.
